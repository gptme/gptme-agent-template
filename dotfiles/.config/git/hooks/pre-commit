# Pre-commit hook: validates branch, prevents protected commits, and runs pre-commit with auto-staging
#
# Features:
# 1. Prevents commits to master/main in external repos without push access
# 2. Warns if branch is not based on latest origin/master
# 3. Runs pre-commit with auto-staging (re-stages files modified by formatters)
